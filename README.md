# sum-it-up

## Summarize email message

This extension was based on the [Hello World Tutorial](https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/hello-world-add-on).

It requires a running [ramalama](https://ramalama.ai/) or [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) server on port 8080 that in can tap into to produce an actual message summary.

The purpose of this extension is to take a long email message and summarize it in a pop up box. This can be helpful when one is doing some categorization/triaging of emails for later processing and you need just a quick glimpse to see what the email is about.
